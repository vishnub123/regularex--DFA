This webpage is created to convert the regular expression to the Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA) 
STEP-1 : Enter a regular expression with similar syntax as  provided in the given examples.
STEP-2 : Ater entering the correct valid expression, click on the convert button to covert the regualr expression to the DFA(Actually in the process of conversion first the regular expression is converted into the Non-Deterministic Finite Automata that is NFA and then this NFA is coverted into our required DFA)
